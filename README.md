# 'Picotar' - the Raspberry Pi Pico W Controlled Guitar

This GitHub project contains all of the files needed to build your own 'Picotar'
Within this project, two example codes are included alongside a digital copy of the printed walkthrough handout as well as the PCB schematic and gerber files. Feel free to use and modify the examples in order to create your own versions, or take the Raspberry Pi Pico W and use it in an entirely different project - we would love to see what you end up creating!; share these with us by emailing nathaniel.dacombe@nottingham.ac.uk
Feel free to also contact by emailing nathaniel.dacombe@nottingham.ac.uk with any queries, questions or feedback

Now for some notes about the example codes...
 - the 'Picotar' project utilises the Mozzi audio library by Tim Barrass
 - full details, including tutorials, examples and forums are available on the Mozzi GitHub page here: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/
 - the variable naming conventions using 'k' stand for 'control' and 'a' stand for 'audio'
 - comments are added throughout the code for your understanding to explain key processes or functions - if anything is unclear, feel free to ask, or search for the functions online

Finally, enjoy and rock on!
